# Standard-forms-for-genealogy

Transcription of printed forms that appear in genealogical research.

Includes a detailed transcription of the preprinted text on the form, indicating
where the form's user is to fill in data and an abridged data extraction version.

The idea is that the abridged version is used to transcribe records where the full form was used.
The prompt for each data item on the original form is short but unambiguous. 
A transcription will have a copy of the abridged form along with the transcribed data along 
with the XML header that specifies the form name and version.
