Each file is a text transcription of a Passenger Manifest variant found on Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.

Each file contains a transcription of the form, with as much detail as possible along with a shorter section containing a Data Extraction form.

The files start with the name of the form-
FORM:YYYY-MM-DD-NN
NN columns

For now, the name of the form is just a date stamp for when it was first created in this list.
The second line indicates the number of columns in the form. 
While not definitive, it provides a quick finding aid.; to determine which form an image is using.



The full transcription is between the markers-

<FULL_TEXT_FORM:START>
<FULL_TEXT_FORM:END>

The data extraction form is between the markers-
<DATA:START:FORM:YYYY-MM-DD-NN>
<DATA: end>

where FORM:YYYY-MM-DD-NN is the same form name as at the start of the file.


Purpose of these files-
* The print of the original form is often difficult or impossible to read in the on-line images. The full transcription provides help.
* When transcribing data from these forms, one doesn't want to include data that doesn't change between instances of the form. The data extraction form gives a short summary of the column names etc. The summary terms listed are arbitrary.
When using the data extraction forms in your text files, be sure to include the delimiters-
<DATA:START:FORM:YYYY-MM-DD-NN>
<DATA: end>
so you will know which full transcription the summary references.


General Notes:

* Text in pointy brackets does not appear in the original printed form.

* Divider lines-
===========================================DIV50==
are provided to make the file easier to parse by eye.

* The "used in" section at the end of the file should give an example of
where the form can be found in use.

* Tab characters are not used, only space characters.
Mono-spaced fonts show the columns aligned. Proportional spaced fonts do not. 

* sections of text that include these line-
<---------------------------->
TEXT A
<-------------OR------------->
TEXT B
<---------------------------->
are used when there are only minor differences between forms-
one variant contains TEXT A, the other TEXT B.
