The goal of this GitHub repo is to make publicly accessible this collection of
standard forms encountered in genealogical research.

As this data collection is not primarily aimed at seasoned software developers, 
the usual GitHub mechanism of contribution by Pull Request may not be helpful- although Pull 
Requests will be be appreciated.
Update contributions will be accepted via the GitHub Issue tracker.
See-
https://github.com/ricko2001/Standard-forms-for-genealogy/issues

Just include the file name that you think should be changed and the old and new text.
We  may have a short discussions about it.

Each update can be suggested by creating a new "Issue".
